A die is thrown 5 times. The experiment results in a sequence \textit{c}\textsubscript{1}\textit{c}\textsubscript{2}\textit{c}\textsubscript{3}\textit{c}\textsubscript{4}\textit{c}\textsubscript{5}, where $c_i$ $\in$ \{1, 2, . . ., 6\} is a positive integer obtained in the \textit{i}-th throw. How many distinct results are there?

\begin{solution}\ \\
Each positive integer \(c_i\) $\in$ \{1, 2, . . ., 6\} of the sequence \(c_1c_2c_3c_4c_5\) is a set. By the Product Rule, the Cartesian product of this sequence of sets is $|c|^n$ where \textit{n} = 5, since there are five sets in the sequence. \[|c|^n = 6^n = 6^5 = 7776\]
\end{solution}
