How many ten-digit positive integers are there such that all of the following conditions are satisfied:
\begin{itemize}
 \item[(a)] each of the digits 0, 1, . . ., 9 appears exactly once;
 \item[(b)] the first digit is odd;
 \item[(c)] five even digits appear in five consecutive positions?
\end{itemize}
\begin{solution}\ \\
Let the sequence of positive integers \(d_1d_2 \cdot\cdot\cdot d_9\) satisfy the above requirements. There are \(|\{0, 2, . . ., 8\}| = 5\) possible positive even digits and are \(|\{1, 3, . . ., 9\}| = 5\) possible positive odd digits. Five even digits must appear consecutively and form the sequence \(d_id_{i+1}, . . ., d_{i+4}\) where \(1 < i \leqslant 5\); there are five possible initial points in the sequence to occur. Since no digit can appear more than once, we subtract one element from the set of odds or from the set of evens with each new digit in the sequence.

\[(5 \cdot 4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1) \cdot (5 \cdot 4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1) \cdot 5 = 72000\]
\end{solution}
