Hello, I hope you are having a nice day.
If you want to engender novel thought and
take leaps forward in your perspectives
on the world, I think it a good idea that
you begin to get out more and seek
a diversity of experiences; from these
experiences your unconscious mind will have
a much richer landscape to work off of and
creativity may flow more freely. Good luck
in life.
