## Chapter 02
- (R-2.4) Write a Python class, Flower, that has three instance variables of type str, int, and float, that respectively represent the name of the flower, its num- ber of petals, and its price. Your class must include a constructor method that initializes each variable to an appropriate value, and your class should include methods for setting the value of each type, and retrieving the value of each type.
- (P-2.33) Write a Python program that inputs a polynomial in standard algebraic notation and outputs the first derivative of that polynomial.
- (P-2.34) Write a Python program that inputs a document and then outputs a bar- chart plot of the frequencies of each alphabet character that appears in that document.
- (P-2.36) Write a Python program to simulate an ecosystem containing two types of creatures, bears and fish. The ecosystem consists of a river, which is modeled as a relatively large list. Each element of the list should be a Bear object, a Fish object, or None. In each time step, based on a random process, each animal either attempts to move into an adjacent list location or stay where it is. If two animals of the same type are about to collide in the same cell, then they stay where they are, but they create a new instance of that type of animal, which is placed in a random empty (i.e., previously None) location in the list. If a bear and a fish collide, however, then the fish dies (i.e., it disappears).
